			<text>A new distance record has been set in the strange world of quantum teleportation.</text>
		</summary>
		<body>In a recent experiment, the quantum state (the direction it was spinning) of a light particle instantly traveled 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) across an optical fiber, becoming the farthest successful quantum teleportation feat yet. Advances in quantum teleportation could lead to better Internet and communication security, and get scientists closer to developing quantum computers.

		About five years ago, researchers could only teleport quantum information, such as which direction a particle is spinning, across a few meters. Now, they can beam that information across several miles. [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]

		Quantum teleportation doesn't mean it's possible for a person to instantly pop from New York to London, or be instantly beamed aboard a spacecraft like in television's "Star Trek." Physicists can't instantly transport matter, but they can instantly transport information through quantum teleportation. This works thanks to a bizarre quantum mechanics property called entanglement.

		Quantum entanglement happens when two subatomic particles stay connected no matter how far apart they are. When one particle is disturbed, it instantly affects the entangled partner. It's impossible to tell the state of either particle until one is directly measured, but measuring one particle instantly determines the state of its partner.

		In the new, record-breaking experiment, researchers from the University of Geneva, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology used a superfast laser to pump out photons. Every once in a while, two photons would become entangled. Once the researchers had an entangled pair, they sent one down the optical fiber and stored the other in a crystal at the end of the cable. Then, the researchers shot a third particle of light at the photon traveling down the cable. When the two collided, they obliterated each other.

		Though both photons vanished, the quantum information from the collision appeared in the crystal that held the second entangled photon.</body>

		<title>Coachella 2023: historic performers, buzzy acts and a return to form - The Guardian</title>

			<text>A record-breakingly diverse and multi-lingual set of acts helped give this year’s desert festival a more contemporary feel</text>
		</summary>
		<body>
		Months from now, after the sense of fizzy overwhelm has lifted and the better-than-expected dust has settled, there will be two moments that recall for me the fire hose of Coachella, beyond the performances and surprises long since blasted across social media and dissected in Reddit threads. The first was a woman in a swimsuit and crocheted cover-up rousing a line of strangers on Friday afternoon with “who’s ready to see Bad Bunny?!” And the second was a snippet heard while dodging people either posing or on their phones in between the giant ferris wheel and trippy, holographic art installations – “how do you take such good pictures?”
		Such was the non-music vibe of the music festival: questionably workable and confidently worn outfits, waiting in line, hype for the headliners, the warmth of desert sun and buzzed strangers. This was my first time at Coachella, but I’ve been on the internet long enough to know certain truths about the festival: it can be chaotic but is slickly run and ever expanding; the headliners could be once-in-a-lifetime or patchy but rarely forgettable. The weekend is as much about the photos and the fashion as the music. Crochet will abound, and Vanessa Hudgens will be there.
		This was borne out (minus Fomo-feeling Vanessa Hudgens) over the festival’s first weekend, its second run-through since the pandemic forced two years off from the annual desert convergence. The fashion was indeed flamboyant and zeitgeisty – butterfly clips and bucket hats and metallic cowboy boots, several remixes of the Euphoria pants, and more variations of a certain Nasty Gal disco chainmail non-top than I could count. I assisted strangers on several photos by the ferris wheel. Other than an hours-long bottleneck for shuttles following Frank Ocean’s bizarre, abruptly truncated set on Sunday evening, the many lines were mostly within reason.
		But beyond the selfies, fashion-watching and the rolling tides of very festival people, Coachella 2023 seemed to continue the event’s embrace of global, ascendant popular music. The crowd was more multilingual and racially diverse than years of Coachella-themed fashion campaigns led me to believe, perhaps owing to precedent-setting headliners – on Friday, the wildly charismatic Bad Bunny kicked off festivities as the first Latino and Spanish-language headliner with a invigorating, justice-minded party that even technical difficulties with guest Post Malone couldn’t derail. A day later, the first Asian and all-female group to headline, K-pop sensations Blackpink, turned up the volume on the weekend with a torrent of militant pop bangers and tightly executed choreography.

		<title>Evan Gershkovich: US journalist arrested in Russia appears in court</title>

			<text>Evan Gershkovich was working for the Wall Street Journal when he was detained on spying charges.</text>

			A Russian court has rejected the appeal of US journalist Evan Gershkovich against his pre-trial detention.

			He appeared in court in Moscow on Tuesday - the first time he had been seen in public for weeks.

			He was arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg while working for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) newspaper and charged with spying.

			Mr Gershkovich stood with folded arms in a bullet-proof glass enclosure, wearing jeans and a blue checked shirt.

			He gave a quick smile while standing calmly, but did not say anything to the reporters present.

			The court rejected his legal team's offer to free him on bail of 50 million roubles ($614,000) or put him under house arrest.

			Mr Gershkovich will stay at a former KGB prison until 29 May at least.

			Along with his lawyer, US ambassador to Moscow Lynne Tracy was also present in the courtroom.

			This is the same court where Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza was just convicted of treason and sentenced to prison on Monday.

			Media were allowed in the courtroom at the start of the hearing before being ushered out and will be permitted to return at the end of the hearing.

			Speaking outside the court after the hearing, Ms Tracy said she had been given access to Mr Gershkovich for the first time on Monday and that he was in "good health and remains strong despite the circumstances".

			"The charges against Evan are baseless and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him," she said.

			"He has a fighting spirit," one of his lawyers, Maria Korchagina, said. "He's working out and he knows that people are supporting him."

			Another one of his lawyers, Tatiana Nozhkina, said: "He's in a combative mood, denies he is guilty, and is ready to prove it."

			When the judge asked Mr Gershkovich if he needed a translation, he replied no - he understood everything.

			He is reading Russian literature while in detention.

			More than 40 countries, led by the US, released a joint statement at the United Nations on Monday calling for Mr Gershkovich's release and condemning Moscow for intimidating the media.

			Mr Gershkovich, 31, was arrested on 29 March and could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of espionage.

			Russia claims he was trying to obtain classified defence information for the US government. Mr Gershkovich denies any wrongdoing.

			His arrest is the first time Moscow has accused a US journalist of espionage since the Soviet era.

			Reporters Without Borders said Mr Gershkovich was covering the Russian mercenary group Wagner in Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow.

			US officials said his driver had dropped him off at a restaurant and two hours later, his phone had been turned off.

			Lawyers for the WSJ have been able to see him and the company said it was doing "everything in our power to support Evan and his family".

			US leaders - President Joe Biden and both Republican and Democratic senators - have condemned his detention.

			His case is now being handled by the US special envoy for hostage affairs.

			At least 65 Americans were being unfairly detained abroad in 2022, according to a report by the James Foley Legacy Foundation.

			The daughter of the human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, who became the first Soviet citizen to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has described the treatment dealt out to journalists as "primitive, unjustifiable, and appalling".

			Tatiana Yankelevich, who is a US-based scholar, has said in an article about her friend Mr Kara-Murza that he is unlikely to survive his 25-year jail term and that "there are many other lesser known but ever-so-courageous people resisting official lies and propaganda".
